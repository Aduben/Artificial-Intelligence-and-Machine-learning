# 🩺 Case Study: Diabetes Risk Prediction

## 📚 Context

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide, and the number of diabetic patients continues to rise. While the main cause remains unclear, scientists believe both **genetic** and **lifestyle** factors play a significant role.

Individuals with diabetes are at risk for secondary health issues such as heart disease and nerve damage. Early detection and treatment can reduce these risks, improve quality of life, and help manage the condition — even though it is incurable.

Researchers at **Bio-Solutions Lab** aim to better understand diabetes among women using **machine learning models** to identify individuals at risk.

As a **data scientist** at Bio-Solutions, your task is to build a **classification model** using a dataset collected by the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**. This dataset includes multiple attributes that may help determine whether a person is at risk of diabetes.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The dataset is designed to answer the following key questions:

- What are the different factors that can help in identifying whether a person is at risk of diabetes?
- Can we build a model to accurately classify individuals at risk?
- What metrics should be used to evaluate the performance of such a model?
