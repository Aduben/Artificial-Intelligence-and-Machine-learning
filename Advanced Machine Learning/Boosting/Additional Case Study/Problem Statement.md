# 🚲 Case Study: Bike Sharing using Ensemble Techniques

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Bike-sharing systems are an innovative form of traditional bike rentals where the **entire rental process is automated** — from membership to return. These systems have seen explosive growth, with over **500 programs** worldwide and **more than 500,000 bicycles** in circulation. They contribute significantly to **urban mobility**, **environmental sustainability**, and **public health**.

**Travel Along**, a new bike-sharing company, wants to expand its **customer base** and provide **optimized services at lower costs**. They've collected data over the past two years, including weather conditions, holidays, and usage patterns.

As a newly hired **Data Scientist** at Travel Along, your task is to:

- Analyze the available data to uncover patterns and insights.
- Predict the **number of bikes rented** using machine learning models.
- Provide **business recommendations** based on your findings to improve operations and customer satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. What are the **key factors** that affect bike rentals?
2. What **business recommendations** can we give based on the data analysis?
3. How can **ensemble learning techniques** (Bagging, Boosting, Stacking) be used to predict the bike rental count effectively?
